# aws-cloudformation-database-cluster

## Synopsis

The
[aws-cloudformation-database-cluster](https://github.com/senzing-garage/aws-cloudformation-database-cluster)
AWS Cloudformation template creates an AWS VPC
and Aurora Postgres serverless database deployment.
The Cloudformation does not deploy Senzing.
Rather, it deploys a database than can be used by other AWS Cloudformations
which do deploy Senzing such as
[aws-cloudformation-ecs-senzing-stack-basic](https://github.com/senzing-garage/aws-cloudformation-ecs-senzing-stack-basic).

## Overview

The `aws-cloudformation-database-cluster` AWS Cloudformation template creates the following resources:

1. AWS infrastructure
    1. VPC
    1. Subnets
    1. IP address and NAT Gateway
    1. Internet Gateway
    1. Routes
    1. IAM Roles and Policies
    1. Security Groups
    1. Logging
1. AWS services
    1. AWS Relational Data Service (RDS) Aurora Postgres Serverless

The following diagram shows a simplified representation of this deployment.

## Preamble

At [Senzing](http://senzing.com),
we strive to create GitHub documentation in a
"[don't make me think](https://github.com/senzing-garage/knowledge-base/blob/main/WHATIS/dont-make-me-think.md)" style.
For the most part, instructions are copy and paste.
Whenever thinking is needed, it's marked with a "thinking" icon :thinking:.
Whenever customization is needed, it's marked with a "pencil" icon :pencil2:.
If the instructions are not clear, please let us know by opening a new
[Documentation issue](https://github.com/senzing-garage/aws-cloudformation-database-cluster/issues/new?template=documentation_request.md)
describing where we can improve.   Now on with the show...

### Legend

1. :thinking: - A "thinker" icon means that a little extra thinking may be required.
   Perhaps there are some choices to be made.
   Perhaps it's an optional step.
1. :pencil2: - A "pencil" icon means that the instructions may need modification before performing.
1. :warning: - A "warning" icon means that something tricky is happening, so pay attention.

## Expectations

- **Time:** Budget 40 minutes to get the demonstration up-and-running.
- **Background knowledge:** This repository assumes a working knowledge of:
  - [AWS Cloudformation](https://github.com/senzing-garage/knowledge-base/blob/main/WHATIS/aws-cloudformation.md)

## Demonstrate using AWS Console

### Launch AWS Cloudformation

1. :warning: **Warning:** This Cloudformation deployment will accrue AWS costs.
   With appropriate permissions, the
   [AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/)
   can help evaluate costs.
1. Visit [AWS Cloudformation with Senzing template](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=senzing-db&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-read-access/aws-cloudformation-database-cluster/cloudformation.yaml)
1. At lower-right, click on "Next" button.
1. In **Specify stack details**
    1. In **Parameters**
        1. In **Senzing installation**
            1. If speed is desired over lower cost, choose "Multiple".
            1. If lower cost is desired over speed, choose "Single".
        1. In **Security responsibility**
            1. Understand the nature of the security in the deployment.
            1. Once understood, enter "I AGREE".
    1. At lower-right, click "Next" button.
1. In **Configure stack options**
    1. At lower-right, click "Next" button.
1. In **Review senzing-db**
    1. Near the bottom, in **Capabilities**
        1. Check ":ballot_box_with_check: I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources."
    1. At lower-right, click "Create stack" button.

## Using deployment

1. By itself, this deployment doesn't do much.
   It is simply the database deployment to be used by subsequent Cloudformations.
1. Example subsequent deployments:
    1. [aws-cloudformation-ecs-senzing-stack-basic](https://github.com/senzing-garage/aws-cloudformation-ecs-senzing-stack-basic)
    1. [aws-cloudformation-ecs-senzing-stack-choices](https://github.com/senzing-garage/aws-cloudformation-ecs-senzing-stack-choices)
